This repository showcases a common, yet subtle, bug in Scala related to immutability. The provided code snippet appears to work correctly, but it highlights a potential pitfall when dealing with immutable objects and their identity.  The `MyClass` is immutable, but the implications of this immutability are not immediately obvious in this simple example.  The solution demonstrates a safer and more predictable approach.
